============

c# library for generating word matrixes for the classic word finder game.

I started a project long ago for the classic word finder game, so I made this library for the core logic. 
Since it never happed to be finished, I decided to make the library public, someone maybe could use it. 

It generates a matrix of up to 50x50 characters and finds all the word occurences in a few seconds.

I've included two small demos, if there's any interest, I will sure make a full documentation.
